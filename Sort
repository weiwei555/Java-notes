Notes:

1. Quick sort (*quick select) | Merge sort | Binary sort

   Quick sort: 
        [ Worst: O(n^2) when pivot is l or h
          Best: O(nlogn) when pivot is mean ]
        Do the sort first (n), then do the sort again recursively for both the left and the right part of the pivot(*n).
   Quick select: 
        [O(n)]
        Do the sort first (n), then do the sort again recursively for One Of the part of the pivot(left or right).
            n + (n/2) + (n/4) + (n/8) + ... = n (1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ...) = n (1 + (<1)) = O(n)

   Merge sort: 
        [O(nlogn)    ---   logn here means log2(n)]
        This is because we have   
        ---------n element------------
        ---n/2----     -----n/2-------
        --n/4-- --n/4-- --n/4-- --n/4-
        - - - - - -- - - - - - - -- - 
        total layers = how many times n need to be divided by 2 to be 1 = log2(n).  (since 2^(log2(n)) = n)
        for each layer, O(n). (O(n) for first layer, O(n/2) + O(n/2) = O(n) for second layer and so on)
        So, total complexity is O(n) * O(log2(n)) = O(nlog2(n)).
         
        Do the merge sort recursion first (base case is when l = h, and there's only one element in that recursive call) for 
        two parts: the first part (before the pivot, which is the input) and the second part.
        Have a empty array for storing sorted elements.
        
        Then, merge these two sorted parts together using two pointers, each pointed to the start of their parts.
        While none of the ptrs points to the end of their parts, compare the number they are pointing to and put the smaller
        one into the sorted array, move that ptr to the next element in its part. (the other one don't move)
        
        When one of the ptrs reach the end of its part, we then just move all the remaining elements after the other ptr to the sorted array.
  
  Binary search (in a sorted array):
        [O(log n)]
        scope: n element -> n/2 element -> n/4 element -> n/8 element -> ... -> 1 element
        total layers(while loop) we need to do to make the scope from n element to 1 element : log2(n). (how many times n need to be divided by 2 to be 1 = log2(n))
        Each layer, we just get the current scope middle, and compare the middle and the answer, update the scope (for the next while loop), which is O(1) operation
        Thus, it will be O(log2(n)) * O(1) = O(log n).
        
        search from the middle, if middle = answer you end.
        1 if middle >= answer, you update the scope to be the front part of the array (update h to be middle)
        2 if middle < answer, you update the scope to be the end part of the array (update l to be middle + 1 for integer, middle if float/double)
        do this again and again (using while) until there is only one element in the scope, and that must be the answer.
        
        Check if this element = answer, if not, answer not found in this array.
        
        Be careful about 1 and 2 because in this way we find the FIRST element in the array that is equal to answer.
        If you need to find the LAST element that is equal to answer, change 1 and 2 accordingly:
        if middle <= answer, update the scope to be the end part of the array. (l = middle)
        if middle > answer, update the scope to be the front part of the array. (h = middle-1 for integer, middle if float/double)
