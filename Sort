Notes:

1. Quick sort (*quick select) | Merge sort | Binary sort

   Quick sort: 
        [ Worst: O(n^2) when pivot is l or h
          Best: O(nlogn) when pivot is mean ]
        Do the sort first (n), then do the sort again recursively for both the left and the right part of the pivot(*n).
   Quick select: 
        [O(n)]
        Do the sort first (n), then do the sort again recursively for One Of the part of the pivot(left or right).
            n + (n/2) + (n/4) + (n/8) + ... = n (1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ...) = n (1 + (<1)) = O(n)

   Merge sort: O(nlogn)    ---   logn here means log2(n)
